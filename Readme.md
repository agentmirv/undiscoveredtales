# Undiscovered Tales
Undiscovered Tales will (someday) be a way to experience homebrew scenarios for the board game [Mansions of Madness Second Edition](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/mansions-of-madness-second-edition).

It is also an opportunity for me to work with Javascript and learn the [Phaser HTML5 game framework](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

#### Editor Prototype Notes

The editor uses [Google's Polymer 2.2](https://www.polymer-project.org).

To add Tiles or Tokens to the map, select the appropriate right hand tab and **Left Click** the item.

In the map, **Left Click + Drag** will scroll the view of the map.

In the map, on a Tile or Token:

* **Right Click + Drag**: Move the item
* **Right Click + Mouse Wheel**: Rotate the item
* **Left Click + Right Click**: Preview of deleting the item
* **Left Click + Double Right Click**: Preview of deleting the item and confirm deletion

On a Token in the map, **Left Click** will mark it for selection, which in the future will allow the Token properties to be shown and changed on the Selected tab.
