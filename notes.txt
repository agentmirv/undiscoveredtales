It is not a problem to create factory functions (or constructors) to create tokens and dialogs.

One problem is, each instance needs different parameters to the constructor (like text and image references).
These sets of parameters can be expressed as JSON objects.

Load Json File
http://phaser.io/examples/v2/loader/load-json-file

Load Tilemap Json
http://phaser.io/examples/v2/loader/load-tilemap-json

Another problem is, there needs to be a way to tell a token to create a dialog or a dialog to create another dialog or token (like a reveal).
Each different instance (including message and image) of token or dialog can be represented by and ID (or by both ID and type).
The JSON object instance can have an ID and type.

Another problem is, a JSON object instance may need to signal (eg destroy) an object in the world.
A list or array of these objects can be maintained, and where the JSON object IDs are the keys.

Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty
* unlike the in operator, this method does not check down the object's prototype chain.

Adding tweens to groups
http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/1686-adding-tweens-to-groups/
Group.alpha is a public property now

Group Transform Tween
http://phaser.io/examples/v2/groups/group-transform-tween
game.add.tween(robot.scale).to( {x: 1.2, y: 1.2}, 1000, Phaser.Easing.Back.InOut, true, 0, false).yoyo(true);

Fading In A Sprite
http://phaser.io/examples/v2/tweens/fading-in-a-sprite
sprite.alpha = 0;
game.add.tween(sprite).to( { alpha: 1 }, 2000, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true, 0, 1000, true);

So to fade in a dialog group would be something like:

dialogGroup.alpha = 1; // by default
game.add.tween(dialogGroup).from( { alpha: 0 }, 2000, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true, 0, 1000, true);

Then set the onComplete signal to destroy the group.

Thinking of moving the hud buttons to the top of the screen.

Next time, work on the player targeted random events.
This means I need some example player objects and a new random event that targets a player.
Do I create a random event type, or target? This would target either a mapTile or player.

Once I have players, should I create a player screen and a load screen?

Random Events
  Are there ones that are templates which have multiple random rooms?
  Some result in finding items. This means that those items can't be found again somehow.

Scenario Events
  What if more than one event qualifies (say more than one is found that happen after turn 6)?
  What about when a dialog is followed by a reveal map (I think this happens in cycle of eternity)?

Conditions
  Cycle of eternity - there is a scenario event where Eugene is killed if the kitchen is not explored by the 2nd turn.
    This starts with a reveal dialog on the door token.
    Then followed by a reveal dialog for the Hunting Horror.
  Cycle of eternity - there are several that are a reveal dialog for a cultist.
    Then followed by a reveal dialog for Eugene moving.

A map reveal should be like other reveals?
  * A list of mapTiles
  * Remove doors
  * Move player to center of mapTiles
  * Display first Dialog

A factory method would load all the reveals and process the first, which would be the map reveal (eg lobby).

I want to see if I can replace the customCallback and follow with tween on location.
The follow for click movement and key movement can stay?

This seems to work:
var moveTween = game.add.tween(player.body).to({ x: game.gamedata.playerStart.x + 100}, 600, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true, 0, 0, false);

I have replaced the customCallback with position tweens.
I have refactored map reveals outside of reveal lists.
This allows for scenario events that start with a dialog and are followed by a map reveal.

What about all the things that Eugene can do in Cycle of Eternity?
There are a number of conditions that are evaluated when Eugene moves, and also is later discovered in a previously unexplored room.

===========================================================
2016 October 23, Sunday 06:13 PM ~~~
===========================================================
So, let's say you want a token to open a particular dialog, based on a condition.
Let's also say this condition is based on the value of a 'global' variable (not one stored in a dialog, like the skill check).
This means the token must evaluate the condition on the global.
This also means that another thing, like a dialog, must set the value of the global.

What would this look like?

{
  "id":"token-box-lobby",
  "x":1200,
  "y":1200,
  "imageKey":"search-image",
  "clickId":"dialog-box-lobby",

  "clickConditional": [
    {
      "variable": "box-lobby",
      "value": "initial",
      "dialogId": "dialog-box-lobby"
    },
    {
      "variable": "box-lobby",
      "value": "tried",
      "dialogId": "dialog-box-lobby-tried"
    }
  ],

  "addToWorld": true
},
...
            } else if (action.type == "setGlobal") {
                var globalVar = game.globalVars.find(function (item) { return item.id == action.globalId });
                globalVar.value = action.value
            }
...

And so, you would need to declare this global somewhere, with an initial value.

"globals": [
    {
        "id: "box-lobby",
        "value: "initial"
    }
]

I guess this isn't too bad.

This could handle Eugene's different dialog states.
He would still be represented by different tokens, depending on where in the house he is.
But within those tokens, these conditions could be used.

Do I want to go down the road of condition data structures yet?
Not yet.

This will be needed for scenario events with more involved conditions.

===========================================================
2016 October 24, Monday 06:40 PM ~~~
===========================================================
So, scenario events...

The first condition we encounter in Cycle of Eternity is a condition on the turn count.
If the Dining Room is not revealed by the Mythos Phase of the 2nd turn, Eugene is not saved.

The second condition we encounter is investigator count.
The turn that triggers the appearance of the first cultist depends on investigator count.
  2 Investigators:
  * First Cultist appeared after 5 turns.

  3 Investigators:
  * First Cultist appeared after 4 turns.

  4 Investigators:
  * First Cultist appeared after 4 turns.

  5 Investigators:
  * First Cultist appeared after 3 turns.

There are some scenario events that could have a global flag as a condition.
* If the wiring puzzle is not solved in the current turn, a fire spreads on the next turn.
* Reading of the arcane script gives a spell on the current turn, a Deep One is revealed on the next turn.
* If you have read the diary and then smashed the urn, the ghost is revealed (still not sure of the exact conditions on this one).

On question on Eugene,
When Eugene moves into an unexplored tile (the Study), what happens to him?
We discover him later; when the Study is revealed, he is also revealed.
Is the Eugene reveal-dialog appended to the Study's reveal list?
Is the Eugene reveal-dialog already present on the Study's reveal least, but revealed based on a global condition?

===========================================================
2016 October 25, Tuesday 06:35 PM ~~~
===========================================================
The wiring puzzle scenario event opens a token dialog, the continue would set the fire flag.
Actually, the wiring puzzle appears to have different penalty outcomes.
The smashed urn scenario event opens a reveal token dialog.
The cultist scenario event opens a reveal token dialog.

Also, the wiring puzzle has the random (conditional) dialog after the search dialog.
This is different than the conditional placed at the token level.
Perhaps you could point a token or dialog button to an id that was a condition itself.
Then that condition would resolve and do the appropriate thing?
Maybe leave this as a refactoring goal (after implementing without that concept).

Random events will probably also be treated like random events, put into an array and shifted off.
But, the scenario events won't be re-shuffled like the random events.
Although, the reshuffling of random events only exists right now because I don't have a lot of random events defined.
